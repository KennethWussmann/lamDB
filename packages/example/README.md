# @lamdb/example

TypeScript project with CDK that showcases one way how to use `lamDB`.

Notice that while the `lamDB` CDK construct is currently only available for CDK powered by JavaScript & TypeScript, you can work with the deployed database from any language and tech stack. Even from outside of AWS. This project should just show one way to work with it.
